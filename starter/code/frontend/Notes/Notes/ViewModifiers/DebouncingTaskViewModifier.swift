  /// A version of the task modifier that debounces changes.
  ///
  /// If the value changes within the `debounceTime` period, any previously
  /// scheduled actions are cancelled and a new action is scheduled to run after
  /// the `debounceTime` elapses again. This ensures the action only executes
  /// when the value remains unchanged for the full duration of the `debounceTime`.
  ///
  /// - Parameters:
  ///   - id: The value to observe for changes. The value must conform
  ///     to the <doc://com.apple.documentation/documentation/Swift/Equatable>
  ///     protocol.
  ///   - priority: The task priority to use when creating the asynchronous
  ///     task. The default priority is
  ///     <doc://com.apple.documentation/documentation/Swift/TaskPriority/userInitiated>.
  ///   - debounce: The amount of time to wait after each value change before
  ///     running the `action` closure.
  ///   - action: A closure that SwiftUI calls as an asynchronous task
  ///     before the view appears. SwiftUI can automatically cancel the task
  ///     after the view disappears before the action completes. If the
  ///     `id` value changes, SwiftUI cancels and restarts the task.
  /// - Returns: A view that runs the specified action asynchronously before
  ///   the view appears, or restarts the task when the `id` value changes.
